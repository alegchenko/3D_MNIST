# 3D_MNIST
80%+ ac on 3d mnsit with custom 3d convs kernels (hyper tanh, polinom, Gabor filters, hyperboloids) + x2 augmentation + Dropout + Batch norm. Main idea of this kernels is generating kernel with a few parametrs, adding a structure to the kernel should lead to faster and easy convergance. Full description and code will be add later.
